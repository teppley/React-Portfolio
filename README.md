## Description

This is my personal portfolio made with react, next.js, tailwind, and firebase. This showcases some of the skills I've learned during the bootcamp course. It is made with mobile in mind and looks great on small displays. I added links to github, linkedIn, and some of the projects I've created. I used tailwind to style and animate elements of the webpage.
